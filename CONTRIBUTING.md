# Contributing to Open Checklist Project

Thank you for helping improve the open trading card data ecosystem!

## Ways to Contribute

- Add or fix a card or set in `/data`
- Help improve the schema in `/schemas`
- Suggest or submit validation tools in `/tools`
- File issues or bugs

## Guidelines

- Follow the existing folder structure
- Validate your YAML before submitting
- Use pull requests — all changes are reviewed

## Pull request scope

To keep PRs reviewable and CI fast, scope each PR to a single concern:

- **One set per PR.** Add or update exactly one set (`data/<genre>/<set-id>/`) per
  pull request. Do not bundle multiple sets together — a single PR spanning many
  sets and tens of thousands of files cannot be meaningfully reviewed.
- **Keep tooling separate from data.** Changes to `/tools` or `/schemas` go in
  their own PR, not mixed with data additions. Open an issue first for new tooling.
- **Rebase, don't merge.** Keep your branch's history linear; avoid merge commits
  from `main`.

## Tooling contributions

Tools in `/tools` are welcome, but they must be **generic and reusable** by
others — not one-off scripts tailored to a single import:

- Drive behavior through **arguments, config files, or input data**, not
  hardcoded constants for specific sets, URLs, or filenames.
- A new set must be addable **without editing the script**.
- Avoid dependencies on local files that aren't in the repo (e.g. a private
  spreadsheet on your machine).
- Prefer tools that **validate, transform, or consume** the published data over
  one-off generators used to produce a single contribution. Keep that kind of
  personal scaffolding in your own fork.

## Bulk and generated imports

Large, machine-generated checklists are welcome, with a few expectations:

- Submit them **one set at a time** (see above).
- Record provenance in the data itself: a `metadata.source_name` / `source_url`
  on the set, and per-card `external_links` pointing to the source. Raw source
  files (e.g. spreadsheets) should **not** be committed — keep them out via
  `.gitignore`.
- Generated parallels and variations are accepted on a best-effort basis. As an
  open-data project, accuracy is refined over time through follow-up corrections,
  so initial imports do not need every record independently verified.
- Use real `image_url`s where available; omit the field rather than committing
  placeholder URLs.
